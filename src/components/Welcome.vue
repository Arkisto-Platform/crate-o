        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Crate-O is a browser-based editor for Research Object Crates ([RO-Crate]). RO-Crate is a flexible,
          developer-friendly approach to linked-data description and packaging . Crate-O is designed to:
          describe files on a userâ€™s computer and to add contextual information about those files
          OR, to skip the files and describe abstract contextual entities such as in a Cultural Collection or an
          encyclopaedia
          OR to annotate existing resources elsewhere on the web
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          NOTE: Crate-O is for Google Chrome and related browsers ONLY at this stage as it describes files on the users
          computer, and saves RO-Crate metadata there. We will be releasing versions that work with online resources
          directly
          which will be compatible with other browsers (see the Roadmap).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          While the current version of Crate-O is designed for editing self-contained RO-Crates (and works fine with
          crates
          containing tens of thousands of entities) - our roadmap includes editing fragments of larger linked-data
          resources,
          and integration with Arkisto repositories such as the [Oni] repository, data API & search portal.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Crate-O is currently developed by the Language Data Commons of Australia ([LDaCA]), under the guidance of
          Peter
          Sefton as technical lead. If the tool is adopted in other contexts (we are in talks with a few groups about
          this) then we aim to establish a steering committee / reference group to help guide development.
