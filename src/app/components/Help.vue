      <li><strong>Selected Directory</strong> shows the directory or folder you currently have open.</li>
      <li>Below <strong>Selected Directory</strong>, you will see a home icon followed by a file path that indicates
        where you are located in the collection levels. This will change as you navigate to different sublevels.</li>
      <li>Depending on the metadata group, different types of metadata will be available:
        <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-5">
          <li><strong>About</strong> - The core metadata for this RO-Crate and its subject matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Related People, Orgs & Works</strong> - The context for the creation of this RO-Crate; who made it, funded it etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure</strong> - How the parts of this RO-Crate relate, such as collection and object relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Provenance</strong> - Detailed description of how entities were created, by whom and with which tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Space & Time</strong> - Where and when the data was collected; the times and places it mentions or describes.</li>
          <li><strong>Software & Hardware</strong> - For computer programs and execution environments that could be used to create data, have created data, or are being packaged and described.</li>
          <li><strong>Others</strong> - Other properties not in the above categories. Note that if you find a property in `Other` that should be in one of the above groups or have other suggestions, please raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/crate-o).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the right-hand panel, there are some further options related to navigating and creating metadata entities:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-5">
      <li><strong>Create New Entity</strong>: Create a new metadata entity, such as a
        provenance action such as CreateAction, which describes how a work is created with more precision than a
        property like `author`.</li>
      <li><strong>Links from</strong>: When located in a sub-group, select to view the parent group(s).</li>
      <li><strong>All Entities</strong>: Select to view all metadata associated with your collection.</li>
