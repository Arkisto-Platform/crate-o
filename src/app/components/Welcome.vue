    <p class="">
      Crate-O is a browser-based editor for <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
        href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research Object Crates
        (RO-Crate)</a>.
      RO-Crate is a flexible,
      developer-friendly approach to linked-data description and packaging.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Crate-O is designed to:
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>describe files on a userâ€™s computer and to add contextual information about those files,</li>
      <li>skip the files and describe abstract contextual entities such as in a Cultural Collection or an encyclopaedia,
        or</li>
      <li>annotate existing resources elsewhere on the web.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Crate-O works only with <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
        href="https://google.com/chrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
        Chrome</a> and <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://microsoft.com/edge"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Edge</a> at this stage as it
      describes files on the user's
      computer, and saves RO-Crate metadata there. We will be releasing versions that work with online resources
      directly which will be compatible with other browsers (see the
      <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
        href="https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/crate-o#roadmap--backlog" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadmap</a>).
    </p>
    <p class="">
      While the current version of Crate-O is designed for editing self-contained RO-Crates (and works fine with
      crates
      containing tens of thousands of entities) - our roadmap includes editing fragments of larger linked-data
      resources,
      and integration with Arkisto repositories such as the Oni repository, data API and search portal.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Crate-O is currently developed by the <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
        href="https://www.ldaca.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Language Data Commons of Australia
        (LDaCA)</a>, under the guidance of
      Peter Sefton as technical lead. If the tool is adopted in other contexts (we are in talks with a few groups
      about this) then we aim to establish a steering committee/reference group to help guide development.
