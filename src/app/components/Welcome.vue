        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Crate-O is a browser-based editor for <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                                                   href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate" target="_blank"
                                                   rel="noopener noreferrer">Research Object Crates (RO-Crate)</a>.
          RO-Crate is a flexible,
          developer-friendly approach to linked-data description and packaging.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Crate-O is designed to:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>describe files on a userâ€™s computer and to add contextual information about those files,</li>
            <li>skip the files and describe abstract contextual entities such as in a Cultural Collection or an encyclopaedia, or</li>
            <li>annotate existing resources elsewhere on the web.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          Crate-O works only with <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                                href="https://google.com/chrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
          Chrome</a> and <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://microsoft.com/edge"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Edge</a> at this stage as it
          describes files on the user's
          computer, and saves RO-Crate metadata there. We will be releasing versions that work with online resources
          directly which will be compatible with other browsers (see the
          <a class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline"

             target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roadmap</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          While the current version of Crate-O is designed for editing self-contained RO-Crates (and works fine with
          crates
          containing tens of thousands of entities) - our roadmap includes editing fragments of larger linked-data
          resources,
          and integration with Arkisto repositories such as the Oni repository, data API and search portal.

          Peter Sefton as technical lead. If the tool is adopted in other contexts (we are in talks with a few groups
          about this) then we aim to establish a steering committee/reference group to help guide development.
